Project Description
LearnIt is a full-stack web application designed to help users enhance their learning through the use of digital flashcards. Users can register, log in, and manage their own flashcards, which consist of questions and answers. The flashcards can be flipped for interactive learning, and users have the ability to add or delete cards as needed. The app features a protected dashboard, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their flashcards.

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and effective tool for memorization and learning, especially useful for students preparing for exams or anyone looking to improve their knowledge retention.
